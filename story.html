                    <p>Our story started as all good love stories do… on the internet! </p>
                        
                    <p>We were immediately comfortable in each other’s company and knew that this was something special. After only a month of dating, we took a
                    road trip together… to Cleveland, of all places! In Cleveland, after an emotional trip to the Rock
                    and Roll Hall of Fame (Eryn’s dad loved The Beatles) hunger took over and we found a Ramen restaurant
                    to rest our weary eyes and feet, and to warm ourselves up. It was there, over two bowls of hot Ramen,
                    that Chris told Eryn that he loved her; of course she felt the same way! And so paved the way to
                    the happy occasion we are now celebrating… our wedding! </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>Again wasting no time, we moved in together in July, not forgetting about our first fur baby, Charlie. Through good times and difficult times,
                    our stuck by each other's sides. Difficult times would be an understatement when our we to say goodbye
                    to Charlie, vowing we would never have another dog… then came our second fur baby, Phoebe. </p>
                    
                    <p>Currently you can find us making our way through these crazy times, otherwise known as the global pandemic,
                    being together 24/7 in a small apartment, and building a life our love. The support of our family
                    and friends has never gone, and will never go, unnoticed. It only helps our love grow stronger. </p>
                    
                    <p>This is still just the beginning of our epic love story. Stay tuned to find out what’s next!</p>
